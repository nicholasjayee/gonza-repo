## 🎯 System Overview

Gonza is a comprehensive **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system designed to run modern businesses. It is architected as a **Monorepo** containing four specialized applications working in harmony:

| Application | Port | Role | Description |
|-------------|------|------|-------------|
| **🌐 Website** | `3000` | Public Facing | Marketing landing page, legal documents (Terms/Policy), and product showcase. |
| **🔐 Auth** | `3001` | Security | Centralized authentication provider. Handles Login, Signup, and Session Management. |
| **💼 Client** | `3002` | Operations | The core business dashboard. Used by staff and managers for day-to-day operations (POS, Inventory, etc). |
| **🔧 Admin** | `3003` | Governance | Super-admin terminal for system-wide configuration, user management, and global analytics. |

## 🧭 Lean Routing Architecture

We utilize a **Catch-All Routing Strategy** to keep the `app` folder clean and scalable.

*   **Old Way**: `app/sales/page.tsx`, `app/inventory/page.tsx`... (Hundreds of folders)
*   **Gonza Way**: `app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` (One dynamic file)

This single file dynamically loads the correct module from `src/{module}/ui/pages` based on the URL.
